TO DO LIST
==========

* Make world wrap.  When ship goes off a side, it appears on the other side.
  Actually, when the ship *disappears* off one side, it will appear on the
  other side.  Probably do this with four hidden rectangles outside the screen
  that get triggered when the ship hits them.  (See the score thingy in poopy bird)
   
* Add thrust animation

* We are not looking at "touch moved" events.  That means that dragging your
  finger off a button when not be detected as a release.  Maybe this is OK.
  Implement this if it becomes a problem.
   
* Show a "reverse image" sprite for buttons that are currently pressed so we
  can tell they are pressed.
   
* Add asteroids

* Add score
